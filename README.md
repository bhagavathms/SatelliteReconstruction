# Satellite Time-Series Reconstruction using DTS & Classical Smoothers

This project implements **Dynamic Temporal Smoothing (DTS)** – a gap-filling and denoising algorithm used in satellite time-series reconstruction.  
We compare DTS with four commonly used smoothing techniques:

✅ DTS (Dynamic Temporal Smoother)  
✅ Cubic Smoothing Splines  
✅ LOWESS  
✅ Savitzky–Golay  
✅ Whittaker Smoothing

---

## 🎯 Objective

Reconstruct missing satellite observations (ex: due to clouds) and analyze:

- Spatial reconstruction accuracy (error maps)
- Temporal smoothness vs. real variability
- Runtime performance
- Method-wise strengths & weaknesses

This contributes to the evaluation of techniques used for **vegetation dynamics monitoring** such as NDVI/EVI2 over croplands.
